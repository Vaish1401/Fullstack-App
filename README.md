"Time-Series Data Visualization App" leverages modern technologies to provide a robust solution for managing and visualizing time-series data. The backend, powered by Flask and PostgreSQL, stores and serves time-series data via a gRPC server, ensuring efficient data handling and retrieval. On the frontend, built with React and integrated with Highcharts, users can visualize the stored data dynamically and intuitively. Docker containers encapsulate each component, ensuring easy deployment and scalability. This project aims to facilitate real-time data analysis and monitoring across various domains such as IoT, finance, and weather forecasting. By combining powerful backend data management with a responsive frontend interface, our app empowers users to make informed decisions based on insightful data visualizations.
